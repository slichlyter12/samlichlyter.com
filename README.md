This is v2 of my personal website.
It's currently a work in progress and yet to be deployed anywhere.

The end goal is to have a place where all of my public, online activity can be gathered together.
This currently includes my Mastodon posts (toots) and boosts, and will soon include my Pixelfed and Instagram posts, and maybe eventually my GitHub activity.

All of this is done using GatsbyJS to hook into my social networks which posts can be queried using GraphQL.
To learn more about GatsbyJS see the list of technologies below.
